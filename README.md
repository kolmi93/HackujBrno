We had created an interactive map that is a useful tool for anyone interested in living in Brno.

The map is designed for anyone considering a change of residence within Brno or newly moving to the city.
It provides comprehensive and clear information on the quality of life in different parts of Brno and allows users to easily find out whether the chosen place of residence meets their requirements in terms of various aspects. These include the availability of green spaces, primary schools and kindergartens, doctors, shops, the level of air pollution, etc.

Users can easily select an area on the map and the categories that interest them the most.
They can choose from all 11 monitored categories, or choose one of three personas representing different user categories (single people, families with children, seniors) for an easier selection.
The city of Brno and individual city districts can use the application to identify areas with lower quality of life and to target investments and programs to improve the lives of their residents.

## Project conclusions:
Brno has
- well-developed public transportation network
- air quality index consistently at a good level
- generally very good accessibility of all essential elements of civic amenities

## How to further develop the project:
- optimize the web application for mobile devices
- add ability to save favorite locations and share them with others
- distance measurement - design specific routes instead of air lines
- implementation of AI tools
- add other attributes:
 noise level, availability of high school, population density, cultural opportunities, security and more..
